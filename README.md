# Linux-Tools
I will add some Linux tools here. They are small scripts for tasks you occasionally need and are easy to use.

# Disk Eraser (upload soon)
This tool erases a disk multiple times, making it nearly impossible for anyone to recover the data.    
#### Warning:
I am not responsible for any data loss if you choose the wrong disk!
Please double-check the disk you are selecting before proceeding.
